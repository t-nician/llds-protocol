# LLDS(Low Latency Data Stream)
A UDP based networking protocol for transmitting & receiving data as quickly as possible for various purposes.

#### ⚠️☣️ **WARNING** I do not know what I'm doing <sup>😎</sup> ☣️⚠️

<sup>I have no professional experience with standards or terminiology of network protocols.\
This is an experimental project and is not a safe solution for handling sensitive data.</sup>

**Goals**
* Get it to work. 🚧
* Easily setup a live video/media stream. 🚧
* Multi-client support on one data source. 🚧
* File transfers with checksumming on completion. 🚧
* Encryption support with a simple configuration change. 🚧

I'm going to try and make clones of the client in other languages.\
I might only have the server be in Rust since it works on any device.\
<sup> (as long as I setup the OS specific libraries and functions that would not exist in other OS's) </sup>
