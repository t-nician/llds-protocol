# LLDS(Low Latency Data Stream)
> ⚠️☣️ **WARNING** I do not know what I'm doing 😎 ☣️⚠️

<sup>I have no professional experience with the standards or terminiology of network protocols including handling sensitive data, this is an experimental project and is not safe for handling sensitive data.</sup>

## Goals 
* Get it to work. 🚧
* Encryption support with a simple configuration change. 🚧
* Quickly setup a live video/media stream with multi-client support. 🚧
* File transfers with checksumming on completion. 🚧
---

&nbsp;\
I'm going to try and make clones of the client in other languages.\
I might only have the server be in Rust since it works on any device\
<sup> (as long as I setup the OS specific libraries and functions that would not exist in other OS's) </sup>
